# Cybersecurity Challenge

## Challenge Description
The purpose of this challenge is to learn and improve knowledge in cybersecurity and make learning it a part of daily routine.

## Progress
Here's the progress made so far:

- DAY 1: 
1) 1/4 course cyber-ed.ru
2) Authentication bypass vulnerabilities
3) OS Command Injection Vulnerabilities
4) Access control vulnerabilities 
5) Directory access control vulnerabilities
6) SQL injection
7) XML external entity
8) Cross-site Scripting Attacks (XSS)
9) 10 pages of Charles Severance's book "How the Internet Works"


- DAY 2:
1) Exploiting Day 1 vulnerabilities in network services
2) The practice of "Social Engineering" (reverse shell + swaks)
3) The Practice of "Securing Access"
4) The practice of "Privilege escalation on server systems"
5) Practice "Going beyond the DMZ" (Hack Mikrotik)
6) Full Course cyber-ed.ru completed!

- DAY 3:
1) writing notes for all 16 sections
2) structuring Notion records

- DAY 4:
1) Traffic forwarding, pivoting
2) Writing a roadmap

- DAY 5:
1) I found the competence matrix, added it to the roadmap
2) I passed the lab for "Network intelligence and compromise of Windows machines"
3) felt ethernalblue and tried to hack my virtual machine with a screenshot, webcam, record_mic, hashdump in meterpreter

- DAY 6:
1) Privilege escalation on local network nodes
2) 2 Windows-labs (+ patator, WinPEAS, Remmina)

- DAY 7:
1) Lab "Capturing network infrastructure management" (+ ldapdomaindump, impacket)
2) Lab "Countering detection and response"
3) Thinking through the study week:
  Monday - Computer Architecture, Tuesday - Computer Networks, Wednesday - Operating Systems, Thursday-Saturday - Python/C Programming, Sunday - Day Off

- DAY 8:
1) Computer Architecture : introduction; what are 0 and 1 from the point of view of a computer; number systems; addition, transfer, overflow; solution of the problem of representation of negative numbers; fractional numbers; simplest electronic components; RAM cell device; von neumann principles; components of a computing system; differences in computer architectures
2) Lab "Nmap"
- DAY 9:
1) Introduction to operating systems
2) Purchase of a marker board for taking notes

- DAY 10:
1) Python: I remembered the base: Instructions, Arithmetic operations, Syntax, Linter, Strings, Variables, Expressions in Definitions, Naming, Interpolation, Extracting characters from a string
2) C: Compiler, Variables, Operations, Screen Output, Conditional Operator, Operator Brackets, Homework, Line break, Keyboard input, Writing calculator

- DAY 11:
